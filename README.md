# Odin Book
This is a social media website inspired by facebook. 
It is created as the final project of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project) Ruby on Rails curriculum.

OmniAuth is implemented for Facebook. Active Storage is used for avatar and photo uploads, using cloud storage on [Cloudinary](cloudinary.com).


You can view it live [here](https://social-media-ab.herokuapp.com/) on heroku.

**The initial load time might take some time since the app is hosted for free on heroku**
